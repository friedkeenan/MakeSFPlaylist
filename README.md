# MakeSFPlaylist
A python script designed specifically to add SourceFed (and PhillyD since I did that second) videos to multiple playlists in chronological order. To run this, you need to a client_secret.json file for your Google project.

I made this with only SF in mind, but I could adapt it to work with any channels if I wanted to, but I don't.
